Today i learned how to fetch api data and use async await function, promises and callbacks
also did some work to practice fetching data from api
made a webpage that fetch pokemon image by just give a pokemon name
also a webpage that gives random dog images by just clicking a button
both webpages uses different api and in each JS code i have shown how to use async and await functions commenting out the promise methods
