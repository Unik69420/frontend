more clear understanding about div tag and its properties
imp things, how to remove the underline of link and how to open a new tab when a link is clicked.
  -to open new tab when a link is clicked, <a href="" target="_blank">anything</a>
  -to remove underline, make a class of that anchor tag and 
                      .class-name{ text-decoration:none;}//text-decoration attribute is used
